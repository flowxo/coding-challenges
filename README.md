# Flow XO coding challenges

We'll ask you what kind of challenge we'd like you to complete (you'll find the challenge(s) within this repo). In all cases, follow the guidelines below for how to approach the challenge and what to include.

## The challenges

- [Birthdays](birthdays.md)

## Approaching the challenge

- Only take a few hours at most to complete your challenge.
- If you don't have time to complete it, that's perfectly OK. It's important that the work you do provide is high quality (production ready).
- You can use boilerplate code to kick off the project, but make sure you explain this in the README.
- Create your own repository for this project and check-in frequently (every 15 mins or so), so we can see how your work progresses over time.
- When you're done, share a link to your repository with us.

## The README

Always create a README file that includes:

- How to install and run the project.
- Reasoning behind your technical choices.
- Describe any trade-offs you needed to make and your reasoning.
- Point out anything you might do differently if you had more time.
- Your contact details and any public profiles on developer networks like GitHub, BitBucket, Stack Overflow, etc.

## How we'll review it

When we review your work, we'll be looking for:

- Well organised and structured code.
- A good README file that explains succinctly your approach.
- The app should work in the way that was explained.
- The code is well written, readable, consistent, maintainable and follows best practice.
- Tests are in place and provide good basic coverage.
- UX is good.
- The technical choices (libraries, patterns) are sensible.

## Thank you!

You're taking up your well earned spare time to do this, and we appreciate that. We'll review your work carefully and always give you feedback.
