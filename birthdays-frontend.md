# Birthdays UI (front-end) challenge

The aim is to create a user interface that allows you to keep track of birthdays.

> Note that this is a front-end focused variant on our main [birthdays challenge](birthdays.md).
> Please make sure you don't get the two confused!

When you open the page, you'll be able to see whose birthdays are today, or coming up in the next 2 weeks. It will also tell you how old they are (or will be).

Important: Make sure you also view our [coding challenge guidelines](README.md).

## Main features

- A single UI page that shows you today's birthdays, upcoming birthdays (next 2 weeks), and a list view of all the people whose birthdays you're keeping track of.
- For today's birthdays and upcoming, show how old that person is (or will be).
- The list should show the person's name and date of birth, and a human friendly notation of when each person's birthday is to the list (3 days, 5 months, 6 weeks, etc.).
- The ability to add a new birthday to the list, requiring the person's name and date of birth.
- A search option for the list, allowing you to filter by name.
- There should be an option to delete birthdays too.

## The technical requirements

- The UI should be a client side JavaScript app.
- There should be no back-end, API or persistent - the UI should look like it works but doesn't need to save any kind of state.
- You can use the data below to initialise the app, if you like.
- Use any JavaScript frameworks you prefer (or just go with plain JS).
- For this challenge, tests are not required.

## Example data

```
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "birthday": "1981-08-02"
  },
  {
    "name": "Katie Smith",
    "birthday": "1973-05-20"
  },
  {
    "name": "Anna Jackson",
    "birthday": "1993-10-15"
  }
]
```

## Skills tested

- Client side JavaScript
- Designing a simple UI
- HTML/CSS
- Ability to put a layout together
- UI/UX design skills

## Focus of the challenge

The idea of this challenge is to test your skills in putting together a great UI.

Try not to focus on tooling or the build process for this challenge, just do the bare minimum to enable the UI to run based on the instructions you give.

Instead, it's important to show that you can put together a simple, well laid out UI that looks good. Be careful not to overcomplicate, and get the basics right.
